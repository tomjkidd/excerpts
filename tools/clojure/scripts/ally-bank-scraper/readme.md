# Purpose

This all was necessary because Ally wouldn't let me look further back than
18 months for CSV data. Considering it was provided on the page, I decided
to pull it by scraping html that was extraced using Chrome's developer tools.

The [AllyMoneyMarket.html](./AllyMoneyMarket.html) file holds the 
transactions in a list of tables per year. This table was grabbed by logging
in through a web browser and using the "Copy element" functionality provided
by the Chrome developer tools.

The [ally-bank-scraper.clj](./ally-bank-scraper.clj) file is the script to 
run agains the html file. It handles parsing out the useful information about
each transaction. Enlive is used to parse the structured html.

The [ally-transactions.edn](./ally-transactions.edn) file is the resulting
edn data, which can be loaded into clojure with [read-string](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/read-string).
