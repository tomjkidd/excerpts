A place to put odds and ends writing.

Motivation
==========
This idea came about after talking to [Mo Kakwan](https://github.com/wavewash), 
who insists that I have thoughts and ideas that his kids will need to read about in the future.

I am an internet lurker
-----------------------

I've justified not sharing my thoughts and ideas publicly because I'm rarely the first, 
let alone the most eloquent, person to share them. I don't often participate in the
social scenes of the internet, finding that I prefer to find and explore the things
that other people do.

I've evaded the social tools of my generation
---------------------------------------------

Blogs seem a little too much like a soap box for me. It may be due to some of the first ways that I saw
blogs used while I was in high school, which were mostly just to harass and annoy people.

Twitter and Facebook were fine for grazing, a perfect salad bar of bite-sized interactions
with people I wasn't really familiar with anymore.

And I gave up when the wave of Instagram, Vine, and YouTube Channels hit, creating a magnitude 
of content that I couldn't watch even a remote percentage of, even if I never slept again.

Mo wants me to reform
---------------------

So this is my attempt to correct this, using markdown for future Kakwans, if for no one else!
